## Learning how to learn

The human mind is a very fine machine with amazing capabilities. And like any complex mechanism, it takes study to learn to use it effectively. This standalone section will contain practical information and advice for learning how to learn.

##### Learning How to Learn 03

1. The two-minute principle.    
   The _two-minute principle_ is an extremely easy and useful technique that requires no setup and no special circumstances. How often have you felt _stuck_ in indecision about how to proceed or even how to start, say, a piece of work, a homework, an exam review, or any other thing that you know you have to do but you feel reluctant to start or continue? And how often, for one reason or another, you have been startled out of this frozen state, only to find that you have seamlessly slid into the activity without noticing, and that all resistance has disappeared? In a way, you only had to start, to get yourself into a productive state of _flow_ instead?   
   
   TO DO: The two-minute principle is the simplest technique to do this at will. And that's all it is: one way or another you focus on what you have to do _for 2 minutes_ before you look up and reassess; more often than not, relieved of the pressure of having to _slog through_ "all this work that has piled up", it has jumped into the limited task at hand and bit into it. Chances are that in 2 minutes you will be in a completely different state of mind, able to tick tasks off without any negative emotions, but even with _excitement for every completed piece of work_.    
   
2. Mindset: fixed vs growth.    
   The term _mindset_ refers to the usual way you react to mental challenges. If you can't do something successfully, do you get frustrated and give up, or do you get frustrated and keep banging at it and try new things? A lot of research literature has accumulated that shows that the difference in our reactions to percieved adversity and our reflexive attribution of the difficulties to either _intrinsic ineptitude_ or _not enough training yet_ divide us into two fundamentally different behavioral groups. The former attribution is associated with the so called _fixed mindset_ and the latter with the so called _growth mindset_.
   
   TO DO: The worst thing you can do when you read the above paragraph is to conclude that you have the fixed mindset and that's that. The whole point of talking about mindsets is to convince you to try the other, the growth mindset, and realize that it takes no more effort than the other. It's just a matter of decision. Just like you have no problem deciding between orange chicken and mushrooms with greens at a Panda Express, you can choose to withhold any habitual thoughts of personal inadequacy, and all the fear and pain that such thoughts bring along, and just give it a shot: "I don't understand this, but I will give it some time, look at it from different angles, ask others to see how they think about it, and reassess later". At every moment when you are faced with something new - which in college happens regularly - stay conscious about how you react at the first encounter: are you calm and keep your mind free of extraneous emotions, so you can start thinking about the new thing; or do you try to distance yourself from it and hope it will pass you by? The former is the fixed mindset. The latter is the growth mindset. It's your choice, really.

## Lesson & Assignment 007: Logic gates

This is a lesson and assignment on _logic gates_. Logic gates are circuits which apply logical functions on their inputs and output the result. Logic gates can have 1 or more inputs but usually have only 1 output. They are the building blocks of modern computational hardware, including arithmetic, logic, and control circuits. The logic gates themselves are built out of transistors.

### Section 1: AND, OR, and NOT gates from NPN transistors

#### 1. Study

##### Logic levels
Logic gates are the crucial layer in the _hardware stack_ of a computer, in which continuous voltages are _discretized and abstracted_ into the 1s and 0s that represent _binary numbers_. While logic gates are implemented via complex _transistor-transistor logic_ or _diode-transistor logic_, their function is simple and can be understood in terms of just _functions of 0s and 1s_.

On the electrical level, _logic low_, commonly designated as `0`, is usually taken to be 0V or _ground_ (which is the common reference volgate for the whole circuit), and _logic high_, commonly designated at `1`, is the highest voltage at which the circuit operates. Common logic-high voltages in electronics are 3.3V and 5V. Other values in the range 1V-12V are less common.

The continuous voltage range between _logic low_ and _logic high_ is usually divided in 3 distinct bands:
- _logic low_: [0V, V<sup>low</sup><sub>max</sub>];
- intermediate forbidden: [V<sup>low</sup><sub>max</sub>, V<sup>high</sup><sub>min</sub>];
- _logic high_: [V<sup>high</sup><sub>min</sub>, V<sup>high</sup><sub>max</sub>], where V<sup>high</sup><sub>max</sub> is either 3.3V or 5V.

The intermediate band serves as a buffer, simplifying the recognition circuitry and filtering noise. The simplicity of dividing the voltage range into only 3 bands is also one of the chief advantages of _binary_ as the fundamental number system of computing.
   
##### Logical functions
Logic gates perform _functions_ (relations between input and output signals, in which there is a _single_ output for every _combination of outputs_) on signals that can take one of two values: _logic low_ (aka `0`, or `False`) and _logic high_ (aka `1`, or `True`). In other words, logical functions have the same _domain_ and _range_, equal to the discrete set of `{0, 1}`. (_Note that this is the notation for a **discrete** range. In our case, it consists of the set of numbers 0 and 1, and no others. **Continuous** ranges are represented with the following notation: `[0, 1)` (real-number interval, half-open on the right, including all real numbers between 0.0 and 1.0, excluding 1.0), `(0, 1]`, and `[0, 1]`._) Once we start talking about logic gates and design more complex computational circuits out of them, we forget about voltages, currents, and impedances. Thus, logic gates bridge the _electrical layer_ and the _logical layer_ in the _computer stack_.

The inputs of logic gates are all the combinations of the number of inputs, where each input is in the range `{0, 1}`. For example, a 2-input gate will have the following 4 possible different inputs: `00`, `01`, `10`, and `11`. What this means is that, if we designate the 2 inputs "A" and "B", the input combinations are all of the form "AB". (_Note that here we use the term "combinations" in a mathematically imprecise way, as what we are talking about are actually "permutations". For example, `10` and `01` are **distinct permutations** whereas they represent the **same combination**. That is, order matters for permutations and does not matter for combinations. Since we want the two inputs `10` and `01` to be distinct, we are really talking about permutations._) The single output of the 2-input gate is in the range `{0, 1}`.

##### Boolean algebra
An _algebra_ is a system of rules for the manipulation of a certain _set of mathematical entities_. By this definition, [_Boolean algebra_](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/BooleanAlgebra.html) is the algebra of the two-valued set `{0, 1}`. Mathematically, it is a _ring_, closed under the _meet_ (aka _AND_) and _join_ (aka _OR_) operations, and its two _literals_ are `0` and `1`, which are inverse of each other. Boolean algebra greatly simplifies the understanding, design, and verification of electronic circuits.

##### Truth tables
Because they are discrete-valued, with the only two values `0` and `1`, logic functions can very conveniently be represented as _truth tables_, which are exhaustive and explicit representation of the functional relationship between inputs and outputs. In fact, truth tables are used to _define_ the logic functions themselves. Here is a sampling:

A | B | /A (aka NOT) | AB (aka AND) | A+B (aka OR) | /(A+B) (aka NAND)
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1
0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1
1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1
1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0    

###### Notation                                          
The symbol /A is equivalent to "A-bar" as in 
```
_
A
```
This means the _inverse_ of A. `1` is the inverse of `0`, and vice versa.

##### Logic gate internals
As can be seen on page 2 of the [AND gate datasheet IC](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/sn74ls08.pdf), logic gates are internally implemented as transistor-and-diode cicuits, of which the two principle families are _transistor-transistor logic (TTL)_ and _diode-transistor logic (DTL)_. As we will see in the next part, a basic version of the three principal logic gates NOT, AND, and OR can be implemented with 1 (for NOT) or 2 (for AND and OR) NPN transistors. The industrial implementation looks so much more complicated because it has to meet requirements for _signal stability_, _switching speed_, _drive capability_, and various other parameters, all of which are listed in the [datasheet](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/sn74ls08.pdf).

#### 2. Apply
1. Using the axioms of Boolean algebra, prove/derive/show [DeMorgan's Laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Morgan%27s_laws). This exercise provides a very stable kernel of understanding of Boolean algebra and logical circuits.
2. Using 1 NPN transistor, an LED, and appropriate resistors, build an _inverter_ (aka NOT) gate. In partcular, when the base of the transistor is at 0V, the LED has to be ON, and, vice versa, when the base is at 5V, the LED has to be OFF. Feel free to follow [this guide](https://www.petervis.com/Education/logic-gates/transistor-logic-not-gate-inverter.html). _Hint: The two resistors have to be matched. Since we haven't provided 1K Ohm resistors, and the 10K Ohm ones limit the current too much, you can use 3 x 220 Ohm resistors for the base, and 2 x 220 Ohm ones for the collector load, both **in series**._
3. Using 2 NPN transistors, on LED, and appropriate resistors, build and OR gate. In particular, when both bases are at 0V, the LED should be OFF, and when at least one base is at 5V, the LED should be ON. _Hint: Think of our basic NPN circuit with 10K Ohm at the base and a resistor-and-LED load on the collector. What if you build a second NPN subcircuit as a mirror of "acorss" the first one, and connect the collectors of both together? Try to draw the circuit before you look it up on the [Internet](#logic-gates)._
4. The previous 3 circuits could be driven by just plugging the wire at the base (with a 10K resistor!) directly into the 5V or 0V rail. Now take two converter channels and run the base wires over to the micro:bit. Connect to two digital output pins.
5. Write a program that:
   1. Drives the two inputs (1 input for NOT) of the gate. _Note that thes are output pins for the micro:bit._
   2. It uses the two LEDs at the top-left of the micro:bit matrix to indicate the input levels. That is, the LED at `(0, 0)` should represent the "A" input, and the LED at `(1, 0)` should represent the "B" input. Use brightness 5 for `0` and brightness 255 for `1`. The two LEDs "AB" should correspond to the two digital output pin values that drive the gate through the voltage converter.
   3. Cycles through the 4 input combinations in the order: `00`, `01`, `10`, and `11`.

### Section 2: Drive and read NPN-transistor-based gates with the micro:bit

#### 1. Study

In the circuits from the previous section, the inputs are clearly the transistor bases. The inverter operates the LED opposite of the connection state of the base. The AND gate operates the LED only when both bases are connected to V<sub>cc</sub>, and the OR gate operates the LED whenever at least one of the bases is connected to V<sub>cc</sub>. The LED (with its current-limiting resistor) is the _load_ of the circuit and the indicator of the proper functioning of our gate. Clearly, a lit-up LED represents _logic high_ and a dark LED represents _logic low_.

So, where exactly are the _outputs_ of our gates? The packaged gates are designed so their output pins can drive significant loads without affecting the internal circuit itself and altering its functional parameters, and, conversely, without imposing constraints or requirements to the structure of the load circuit. We'll say more about that in a later section. For now, and for our simplistic implementation of logic gates we need to carefully identify the output of the gate, so that the circuit does not including the load itself. In other words, the circuit terminal we designate as _output_ should allow interchangeable loads.

We used the LED subcircuit as our load, so it is most natural to pick its connection point as the output, namely the _collector_ terminal of the NPN-transistor subcircuit(s) which are directly connected to the load. There are two slightly different alternatives that this choice gives us, as can be seen in the following sketch:

```
To understand the difference, you need to realize that when the bases of your gate circuits from the previous section are closed (0V, which is _logic low_), the voltage on the output terminal is Vcc (5V, which is _logic high_). This is essentially the principle of operation of our basic logic gate design. Both variants above include a subcircuit called _pullup_. It contains the connection to Vcc which we need to switch to when there is no current flowing through our gate subcircuit (becase the base(s) is(are) at 0V). The two variants differ in whether our design includes the pullup subcircuit or is left to the load circuit to provide. This latter design is called _open collector_, as the gate circuit does not include the pullup subcircuit. Both designs exist in industry, though the former is more prevalent. It is also the design of our logic gate ICs.

#### 2. Apply
1. Use a 10K Ohm resistor as the pullup resistor of your gate circuit and designate the collector terminal as the output of the gate.
2. As you drive the gate with the different input combinations, measure the voltage at the output. _Describe and explain your results._
3. Connect the output across a channel of the voltage converer and back into micro:bit as an input pin.
4. Extend the program from the previous section that treats the new input as an _analog_ pin:
   1. Map the range of input readings (the full range is [0, 1023] but, like the soil sensor, you might not get the full range) and calibrate the readings to only two input values, naturally `0` and `1`.
   2. Use the calibrated value to light up the LED at position (3, 0), using brightness to distinguish the two values.
5. Modify the program to treat the input as a _digital_ pin and use the _already mapped_ (aka _discretized_) values to drive the LED at (3, 0).

#### 3. Present
In the [Lab Notebook](README.md), include:
1. A short narrative about the experiment.
2. Gate output voltage measurements and a corresponding description of the mapping in 2.2.4.
3. Gate output voltage measurements and an explaination of the results. _Are you getting proper digital inputs from the gate output? Is your gate operating properly?_
4. Short videos of the operation of the circuits from 2.2.4. (One each for NOT, OR, and AND.)
5. Short videos of the operation of the circuit s from 2.2.5. (One each for NOT, OR, and AND.)

For example, I have a SN74HC00N and I found this more accurate [datasheet](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/sn74hc00.pdf?ts=1588273017402) for it._ The part numbers have the general form XX74YYDDDZ, where XX is the optional family prefix, YY is the logic type, DD/DDD is the gate code, and Z is an optional suffix (see the table below, as well as more details on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7400-series_integrated_circuits#Part_numbering)). While most of these IC packages have the **V<sub>CC</sub>** pin in the top-right corner (when properly oriented with the notch up toward the breadboard power supply) and **GND** in the bottom-left corner, you should double check. There might be different chips that provide the same logic gates, so you should make sure you have the datasheet for each one._

A | B | NOT (04) | AND (08) | OR (32) | NAND (00) | XOR (86) | XNOR (135)
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- 
0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 
0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 
1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 
1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1     

DD/DDD | Function | Units/chip | Chip count | Notes
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
00 | NAND | 4 | 2 | 
04 | NOT | 4 | 2 | 
08 | AND | 4 | 2 | 
32 | OR | 4 | 2 | 
86 | XOR | 4 | 2 | 
135 | XOR/XNOR | 4 | 2 | Multiplexed

##### Reading the datasheets
The contents of the datasheets are going to be similar to the [D-type positive-edge flip-flop datasheet](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/sn74ls74a.pdf?ts=1587765899168) that we are already familiar with. In particular:
   1. There is a verbal description.
      1. Note that all our ICs are _positive logic_, meaning that 1 = 5V and 0 = 0V. (For _negative_, it's the opposite.)
   2. A function and/or truth table gives an at-a-glance definition of the gate's function.
   3. The conventionalal schematic symbol is shown. For example, the following is (roughly) the symbol for the AND gate:
      ```
      A                 |-----------------\
      ------------------|                   \
                        |                   |                AB
                        |                   |------------------
      B                 |                   |
      ------------------|                   /
                        |-----------------/
      ```
   4. Usually next to the symbol, the _Boolean algebra_ expression of the logic function of the gate is shown. For example, the following is the expression for the OR gate:
      ```
                  ___
                  _ _
      Y = A + B = A B
      ```
      The remarkable property of Boolean algebra to describe precisely logical function makes it so important for electronics. More on this in the next section.
   5. The different packages are shown and their pinouts. _You should make sure you are looking at the right package!_
   6. Optionally, the underlying circuit schematic is shown.
      1. You may notice that none of our gates have open collector outputs. Instead, they have _totem-pole_ outputs.
   7. The timing diagrams are shown. They contain, among other parameters:
      1. The signal propagation time.
      2. The switching speed.
      3. The trigger levels.
   8. Various other physical and electrical operating characteristics are specified. Some of those are:
      1. Most importantly for us is the logic-high voltage, which for our gates is 5V.
      2. Load drive capabilities.

##### The underlying circuits
Despite the simplicity of the logic gates on the functional level, the underlying circuits may be fairly complex. 

![alt text](images/and-gate-circuit-schematic.png "And gate circuit schematic")
Circuit schematic of the AND gate [SN74LS08](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/sn74ls08.pdf) implemented in TTL. The elements with the bent vertical bars in their symbols are [Zener diodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zener_diode) and [Schottky transistors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schottky_transistor).

If the first look at the schematic is bewildering, you should bear in mind that the technology is developed over time, with new discoveries and developments being incorporated continuously into the available products until they have reached their present-day complesity. Here is a short article on [TTL logic](https://www.elprocus.com/transistor-transistor-logic-ttl/), one of the most widely used electronic technologies. To take a look into the deeper complexities and benefits of the underlying circuit design and implementation, you can peruse [these slides on DTL and TTL](materials/DTL-and-TTL-Slides.pdf). There have been hundreds of thousands of _patents_ generated along the way. This said, the gates included in our lab kit use 30-40 year old technology.

##### Correct placement
Please, be careful in placing the gate ICs on the breadboard. ICs should be oriented with the _notch_ toward the power supply. Here are two pictures of the gate ICs:

| IC notches | The "notch" of '135 |
:---:|:---:
![](images/ic-notches-and-orientation.jpg) | ![](images/ls135-ic-orientation.jpg)

In both pictures, the ICs are oriented with the notch (or equivalent) to the right. Follow the guidelines in the [lab kit care instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18IDsrQlZY_QkmWG7FFtGqd9M2S1wL8ShJrD00aHwBwQ/edit#heading=h.h1az8g4pd24e). _And don't forget to power and ground your chips. They can't work without being connected to the **V<sub>CC</sub>** and **GND** rails._

#### 2. Apply
1. For each logic gate (pick one of each quad chip), test the functional operation by setting the inputs and checking the outputs. _Measure the output voltages. Alternatively, you can have a small current-limiting-resistor+LED load circuit to test visually._
2. Use the same setup from 2.2.5 (that is, using _digital input pins_ on the micro:bit), this time substituting the IC gate for the piecewise NPN-transistor gate circuit. _Do this for all non-multiplexed gates (NOT, AND, OR, NAND, and XOR)._
3. Add a control signal from the micro:bit to drive the _selector signal_ **C** of the [DM74LS135N](https://archive.org/stream/bitsavers_tidataBookVol2_45945352/1985_The_TTL_Data_Book_Vol_2#page/n567/mode/2up) gate. Add an indication for the state of the C-pin on the LED at position (4, 0). Modify the program accordingly. _Can you switch between the XOR and XNOR gates? Note that you don't have to switch the inputs and outputs. The gate changes "inside"!_

### Section 4: Combinational logic

#### 1. Study

##### Boolean algebra, logic gates, and truth tables
Boolean algebra, logic gates, and truth tables describe the same thing, namely, the fundamental operations on 2-valued data, and, as an extension, the fundamental rules of computation in the binary number system. Boolean algebra is the _mathematical_ representation. Logic gates are the _functional_ representation. Truth tables are the _mapping_ representation. All three are _equivalent_ and _isomorphic_ to each other. Knowing all 3 aspects creates a dense, stable, and satisfying knowledge network, which is right in the heart of computing!

##### Functional sets
The beauty of equivalence goes even further, with gates being able to be implemented by other gates. A _minimal set of gates_ which is sufficient to represent all other gates is called a _functional set_. This means that we can represent every other gate with the gates from the functional set. Here are 4 different functional sets:
  1. {OR. NOT}
  2. {AND, NOT)
  3. {NAND}
  4. {NOR}

As a throught experiment, think about the 4 output values that define a function in a truth table. Each permutation of 4 bits (1-or-0s!) defines a different function, can be expressed with a Boolean algebra formula, and can be built by a functional set. _How many such different functions are there? What are their Boolean expressions? For how many of these do we lack a special name (like AND, NAND, etc.)? What is the minimal set of functional-set gates that can represent them?_

##### Combinational logic
Building gates out of _functional sets_ is essentially stringing gates together to create other functions. Elecrical and timing constraints aside, we can build arbitrarily complex circuits consisting only of gates, where intermediate outputs of gates are inputs to other gates, layer after layer. A circuit which is composed only of gates between its (outer) inputs and outputs is called [_combinational_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinational_logic). Combinational circuits are at the basis for computation.

Combinational circuits are most often contrasted with _sequential_ circuits, which we met in the previous assignment, where we worked with the D-flip-flop and built counters out of it. Both the flip-flop and the counters are sequential circuits, and therefore have multiple stable states and thus memory. The output of a combinatorial circuit depends _only on its inputs_ and the the output is the same for the same inputs. The output of a sequential circuit depends _on its inputs and its current state_ and, because of this second dependencey, may produce different outputs for the same inputs, at different times. Sequential circuits are thus said to depend on time, and particularly on the past. [Sequential circuits](https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/sequential/seq_1.html) are usually implemented as a combinational component and a memory (aka storage) component, in a tight cycle.

As we saw in the datasheets for the logic gates, gates have _propagation delays_. This delay is _additive_ in combinational circuits. The delay of a combinational circuit (aka its _latency_) is the longest time it takes an input signal to propage along a path throught the combinational circuit to reach its output. Because of the cyclical structure of sequential circuit, the _latency_ of the combinational component limits the frequency (speed) of operation of the whole system, and is thus a fundamental design constraint and tradeoff. Simplification of the combinational circuit and/or minimization of the gates while achieving the same overall function is one of the most common tasks in computer engineering.

#### 2. Apply
1. Create a table, listing all the 4-bit output permutations of inputs `00`, `01`, `10`, and `11`. If there is a gate for the permutation (e.g. `0001` is an AND), state it; otherwise, compose it of gates from one of the functional sets. Write the Boolean expression (e.g. AB for `0001`).
2. Compose a combinational ciruit to build AND out of {OR, NOT}.
3. Compose a combinational circuit to build OR out of {AND, NOT}.
4. Compose combinational ciruits to build AND, OR, and NOT out of {NAND}.
5. Compose a combinational ciruit to build XOR out of {NAND}.
6. Side-by-side, build the direct (1 gate) and combinational equivalent gate circuits. Verify that they have the same output:
   1. With an AND gate and an LED load circuit.
   2. On the micro:bit, connecting the two outputs and lighting the two LEDs at (3, 0) and (4, 0) (while the inputs, driven by the micro:bit, are shown on (0, 0) and (1, 0), as in the preceding sections). Use brightness `5` for 0, and `255` for 1.

#### 3. Present
In the [Lab Notebook](README.md), include:
1. A short narrative about the experiments, with answers to the questions in [Part 1](#functional-sets), and the table from 4.2.1.
2. Symbolic diagrams of the combinational circuits from 4.2.2-4.2.5.
3. Videos of the operating circuits from 4.2.6. (One with LED load and one with the micro:bit).

In the [repository](./), include:
1. File `microbit-program-4-2-6.js` with the code you used in task 4.2.6.

### Section 5: Logic analyzer on the micro:bit

#### 1. Study

##### Multi-input gates
Logic gates do not have to have only 2 inputs. While multi-input gates are rarer than the canonical 2-input ones, there are uses in [multi-bit computational components](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_7400-series_integrated_circuits) for which they are perfect. 

For example, let's look at the datasheet for an [8-input NAND gate](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/sn74ls30.pdf?ts=1587846989650). Things to notice:
1. The truth table is non-exhaustive, instead providing an abstract analytical description of the function.

| Inputs A through H | Output Y |
:---: | :---:
All inputs H | L
One or more inputs L | H

2. The TTL implementation is a simple extension of the 2-input NAND.

| 2-input AND | 8-input NAND |
:---: | :---:
![](images/and-gate-circuit-schematic.png) | ![](images/8-input-nand-gate-ttl-schematic.png)

3. The Boolean expression is a simple extension of the 2-input version.

##### Truth table as functional definition of an arbitrary combinational circuit
For complex combinational circuits, the truth table format is the choice for functional definition. Any arbitrary function of multiple inputs and outputs can be represented as a truth table, after which the logic can be designed, optimized, and implemented. The equivalence of the truth tables, Boolean expressions, and logic gates affords this elegant process.

As an example, what follows is the table of the _full adder_, a circuit that adds 2 1-bit inputs and a _carry C<sub>IN</sub>, and outputs a 1-bit _sum S_ and a 1-bit _carry out C<sub>OUT</sub>_. So, this can be thought of as a 3-input 2-outpu combinational circuit.

Row | A | B | C<sub>IN</sub> | C<sub>OUT</sub> | S
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
1 |0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0
2 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1
3 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1
4 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0
5 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1
6 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0
7 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0
8 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1

The output values are determined by the rules of _addition_ in binary. For example, `1 + 0 + 1 = 10` in the 6-th row. So, now that we have the inputs and the outputs, how do we design the circuit? For each of the outputs, we look at the rows containing 1 and create the _sum-of-minterms_ expression. For example, there are 4 rows with 1 inside for S (for simplicity, we are using C for C<sub>IN</sub>):
1. Row 2, for which the input expression (aka _minterm_) is <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\bar{A}\bar{B}C">
2. Row 3, for which the input expression (aka _minterm_) is <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\bar{A}B\bar{C}">
3. Row 5, for which the input expression (aka _minterm_) is <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=A\bar{B}\bar{C}">
4. Row 8, for which the input expression (aka _minterm_) is <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=ABC">

We can read this as: _S is high when the input is either like row 2 **OR** like row 3 **OR** ..._. This gives us the following Boolean expression for S:

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=S = \bar{A}\bar{B}C %2b \bar{A}B\bar{C} %2b A\bar{B}\bar{C} %2b ABC">

After some Boolean algebraic manipulation of this expression, we arrive at the _minimal_ expression:

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=S = A \oplus B \oplus C">

and this can be built with two _cascaded_ XOR gates:

![](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-gv9JtyP240E/WANgshfPGrI/AAAAAAAAAts/vbNF9cZLBRY3-p3PYG3R5fmt7AzHsdVUwCK4B/s640/3%2Binput%2Bxor%2Bgate.png)

We follow a similar procedure for the other output C<sub>OUT</sub>.

#### 2. Apply
1. Show the truth/functional table of an 8-input NOR gate, in two ways:
   1. Exhaustively, with all rows and columns.
   2. Abstractly/analytically, with 2 columns and 3 rows.
2. Show the truth/functional table of a 8-input XOR gate, in two ways:
   1. Exhaustively, with all rows and columns.
   2. Abstractly, with 2 columns and 3 rows.
3. Using the rules of Boolean algebra, prove the 8-input NAND gate expression from the [74LS30](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/sn74ls30.pdf?ts=1587846989650). Assume the 2-input NAND expressions <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=Y = \widebar{AB}"> and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=Y = \bar{A} %2b \bar{B}"> as _axiomatic_ (that is, you don't have to prove them).
4. Count the number of gates the _non-minimized_ expression for the sum ouptut S of the full adder. _What is the gate reduction factor of the minimal expression?_
5. Derive the (i) sum-of-minterms, (ii) minimal expression, and (iii) logic gate implementation for the C<sub>OUT</sub> output of the full adder.
6. Write a _logic analyzer_ program for the micro:bit (for 2-input gates). It should be able to drive a gate, read its ouputs, render them as a truth table on the LED matrix, identify the function, and display its name. Details:
   1. Use the leftmost 2 columns of the LED matrix to represent the gate input permutations. Use brightness levels to represent 0 and 1, as done previously.
   2. Leave the middle column blank for readability.
   3. Use column 3 (0-indexed!) to show the gate outputs.
   4. Prepare to use column 4 for the multiplexed XOR/XNOR gate's second function.
   5. Define the proper digital input and digital ouput pins and run their lines through the voltage converter.
   6. Drive the gate with the micro:bit and record its outputs.
   7. Display the analysis as a slow loop, showing either inputs and outputs line-by-line or first the input columns and then the outputs line-by-line. _Note that you should display the full table, not line-by-line as in the previous sections. These are instructions for how it should be rendered as you apply the inputs and read the output._
   8. Once the truth/functional table is complete, after a 2-sec pause, scroll the name of the gate/function.
   9. Analyze all 2-input gates that are provided in the lab kit.
   10. Build a combinational circuit for a NOR gate and analyze it.
   11. Build a combinational circuit for which there is _no name_ and scroll `"No name"` on the analyzer. _Hint: Take a look at the preceiding task which asked you to list and identify all 4-bit output patterns for 2-input gates._
7. Use the 4-th converter line to drive the multiplexor of the XOR/XNOR gate and analyze it, displaying the functions side by side and columns 3 and 4 of the LED matrix.
8. **CHALLENGE** For the _no-name_ functions, scroll the equivalent Boolean algebra output expression. _Guide: If you lay out the outputs of the function horizontally as a bit pattern (e.g. 0001 for AND), you can interpret it as a 4-bit binary number. Why are they all unique? Having a unique number for each item automoatically gives you an **index**. You can use this index in the data structure you will use to hold the logic gate names. For the logic functions without names, the "output bit pattern" can be used to generate the **minterm expression**, by picking the minterms that correspond to 1s. In fact, this can be done for all 2-input logical functions whether or not they have canonical gate names._
9. **CHALLENGE** Expand the logic analyzer to 3-input gates (and combinational circuits).

### Section 6: Bi-directional binary ripple counter (asynchronous)

#### 1. Study

##### Synchronous vs asynchronous systems
One of the primary design considerations in computer systems and components is whether the system or subsystem is _synchronous_ or _asynchrounous_. Synchrounous means _in step_, _in time_, _at the same time_, but can also mean _at a predictable and/or regular time(s)_. Synchronous systems are usually _centrally timed_ (e.g. by a clock signal) and conform to the timing sygnal. Asynchronous systems, on the other hand, are not centrally timed and execute _as soon as possible_ without waiting for other events or components to sync with. The synchronous-vs-asynchronous topic in computer systems is vast and appears at many levels and in many different design problems. Our introductory intuition-building example is our 3-bit counter, which can be built as both an asynchrounous system and a synchronous system. We built the asynchronous version in the previous assignment. In this section, we'll extend it, and in the subsequent sections we will build the synchronous version as well as other synchronous circuits.

##### Ripple & propagation delay
Our asychronous counter is also called a _ripple_ counter. What makes it asynchronous is that the clock signal only drives the flip-flop for the least-significant bit _b<sub>0</sub>_, whereas _b<sub>1</sub>_ and _b<sub>2</sub>_ receive their "clock" signal from one of the outputs of the preceding flip-flop. As each flip-flop _divides_ the frequency of the preceding flip-flop _(How and why does it do that?)_, there is no single central clock signal that drives the whole system. Thus, the flip-flops of the counter are driven _asynchrounously_.

Recall that logic gates have a _delay_ between the input and output, which we called a _propagation delay_. It's the time the signal takes to propagate through the circuit from input to output. Our flip-flops also have delays, in fact larger ones than the logic gates, because flip-flops are _stateful_ devices and need to _switch_ between one stable state (say, 0) to the other (in this case, 1). Switching always adds extra delays. For example, compare the _switching charecteristics_ section of the [74LS08 AND gate](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/sn74ls08.pdf?ts=1587949352102) (12-19 ns) and the [74LS74 D-type flip-flop](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/sn74ls74a.pdf?ts=1587949244609) (20-40 ns).

Because our counter is asynchronous, the driving signal, which starts from the clock input for the _b<sub>0</sub>_ flip-flop, incurs an extra flip-flop delay with each flip-flop it propagates through. This is the [_ripple_](https://www.electronicshub.org/asynchronous-counter/#What_is_clock_ripple) effect that gives our counter its alternative name. In our counter, in comparison to a synchrounous counter, where all flip-flops receive the same CLK signal, the changes in the bits also exhibit the ripple, where in a synchronous counter the bits will all change _at the same time_.

##### Down counter & up counter
The counter we built in the previous assignment is a _down_ counter. It counts from its highest value down to 0, indefinitely while there is a driving clock signal. To make it count _up_, we need only to change the wiring of a single ripple signal. Read this detailed exploration of [ripple counters](https://www.electronicshub.org/asynchronous-counter/) and answer the following questions: 
1. _What differences between the down-counter and up-counter circuits can you spot?_
2. _Why does the down-counter count down while the up-counnter count up? Draw the timing diagram of the two circuits and reason why/how each cicuit produces its diagram._
3. _Based on your analysis, if we want to have a switchable up-down counter in one circuit, what should do?_

##### Multiplexers
What we need to do for our up-down counter is use a single-line control signal to switch between the two counting directions. We have already seen such functionality before. _Where? Which circuit?_

Devices which have control lines the values of which perform an _exclusive_ selection of on output from a set of different inputs, are called [_multiplexers_](https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/combination/comb_2.html). Multiplexors are, in fact, nothing more than electrical switches. Where as the transistor is an electrical switch that is _either on or off_, multiplexors are _always on but can switch between different outputs_. In a household analogy, the transistor is like an on-off light switch, whereas the multiplexer is your security system which has three different modes: Stay, Away, and Night. _(Of course, you can turn it off completely, but you get the point.)_

The symbol for the simplest multiplexer looks like this:
```
        Selector ------
                      |
                      |
                |-----------|
Input 1 --------|           |
                |           |-------- Output
Input 2 --------|           |
                |-----------|
```
_(Remember that the signals flow from left to right.)_ This is a called a _2-to-1_ or _1-out-of-2_ multiplexer. When the selector is `0`, `Output = Input 1`; when the selector is `1`, `Output = Input 2`. Answer the following questions:
1. _How is a multiplexer different from a logic gate?_
2. _Does a multiplexer have state? Depending on your answer, is a multiplexor a sequential or a combinational circuit?_
3. Notice that a 1-bit selector can multiplex between 2 inputs. Let's generalize this. _How many control lines would you need for a _4-to-1_ multiplexer? What about for a _8-to-1_ multiplexer? What about for a _5-to-1_ multiplexer? What about for an N-input multiplexor, where N is an exact power of 2? What about for an M-input multiplexor, where M is **not** an exact power of 2?_

Multiplexers are a fundamental element of _control_ ciruits in [processors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_architecture) and _[bus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_(computing))_ switch hubs, among others.

##### Multiplexer out of logic gates
While a multiplexer is not a logic gate itself, it can be built out of logic gates. Here are two different implementations:
1. [4 NAND gates](https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/combination/comb_2.html)   
2. [2 AND, 1 OR, and 1 NOT gates](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/logicblocks-experiment-guide/all#7-2-to-1-multiplexer)   

While they are functionally equivalent, from the perspective of circuit real estate, the first one is more efficient than the second (1 IC vs 3 ICs). _Write the Boolean expressions for both circuits and show that they are equivalent._

#### 2. Apply
1. We only have 4 voltage converter channels, so to add a control line, we need to open up a channel. Remove the MSB of the 3-bit counter. A 2-bit counter will be sufficient to demonstrate our up-down counter.
2. Build a multiplexer out of logic gates.
3. Modify your previous counter program to drive the selector from a digital output pin on the micro:bit by toggling a button. _Test the circuit. Does it switch its direction?_

#### 3. Present
In the [Lab Notebook](README.md), include:
1. A short narrative about the experiments, including answers to all the questions in 6.1 and 6.2.3, as well as any relevant discussion. 
2. A short videos of the operating circuit from 6.2.3.

In the [repository](./), include:
1. File `microbit-program-6-2-3.js` with the code you used in task 6.2.3.

### Section 7: Bi-directional synchronous circuits (IN PROGRESS)

#### 1. Study

##### Applications of synchronous and asynchronous circuits
- the processor is a very complex synchronous system
- long memory-bound tasks are executed asynchronously

##### Timing in electronics and computing
- datasheets, levels of abstraction)   
- [The micro:bit - a reactive system](https://makecode.microbit.org/device/reactive) article in micro:bit reference    
- process scheduling (fibers, interrupts, events, scheduling)    
- communication protocols    
- the processor and interrupts  

##### The delay in the micro:bit driven ripple counter
- the delay in the micro:bit which limits the frequency of the CLK signal  
- comparison of two implementations  
  - w/ [`onPulsed`](https://makecode.microbit.org/reference/pins/on-pulsed) on every change (asynchronous via _interrupt_)  
    - `onPulsed` triggers on level change and 2nd argument is the final level (verify in software stack)
  - w/o (synchronous via _polling_)

### JavaScript

1. Technically, the language which is used side-by-side with Blocks in the Makecode ronment is a subset of [TypeScript](https://makecode.com/language), which itself is a superset of JavaScript (technically, [ECMAScript](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/10.0/index.html#Title)), with some JS features not implemented in Makecode.
2. The limited [JavaScript mini-tutorial](https://makecode.microbit.org/javascript) in Makecode.
3. Official [TypeScript documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/home.html):
   1. TypeScript in 5 min [tutorial](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html). _Note: You will need to [download](https://www.typescriptlang.org/index.html#download-links) and install an integrated development environment (IDE). The two that I recommend are Visual Studio Code from Microsoft and WebStorm from JetBrains._
   2. The full documentation and reference is under _Handbook_. Bear in mind that you are drinking from the hose. Don't be surprised if not everything is presented in a strictly incremental manner.
4. In-browser TypeScript [playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/index.html). Note that micro:bit specific code will not run, but you can still play. _Start making the distinction between a generic multi-purpose programming language (TypeScript) and functionality (packages, libraries, objects, etc.) that is specific to a particular device (micro:bit), though written in the same programming language._
5. A pretty good and very palatable JS tutorial with in-browser coding, by [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript).
6. Extensive and detailed [JS tutorial](https://javascript.info/), with some advanced material thrown in. **I like this one!**
7. The most authoritative JS resource on the Web, including tutorials and reference, by [Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript).
